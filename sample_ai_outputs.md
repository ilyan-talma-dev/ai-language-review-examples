# AI Output Review Examples

Example 1

AI Output:
"Il fait un temps de chien." → The weather is about dogs.

Issue:
Literal translation error.

Correct interpretation:
It means the weather is terrible.

Feedback:
The model translated word-by-word without recognizing the idiomatic expression.
The system should be trained to detect idioms before translating.


Example 2

AI Output:
"Je suis plein." → I am full.

Issue:
Context misinterpretation.

Correct interpretation:
When said after eating, it means "I am full."
When said in a different context, it can sound unnatural or incorrect.

Feedback:
The model output is technically correct but context-sensitive.
Evaluation should consider context before marking an output as correct or incorrect.
