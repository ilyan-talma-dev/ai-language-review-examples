# Review Reasoning Approach

When reviewing language output, the goal is not only to detect mistakes but to explain them clearly.

Key principles:

- Always identify the type of error.
- Distinguish between literal errors and contextual errors.
- Explain reasoning step by step.
- Avoid vague judgments such as "wrong" without explanation.

Strong reasoning is more valuable than simply giving the correct answer.
